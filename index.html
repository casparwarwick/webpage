            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am an Assistant Professor with the <a href="https://www.wbs.ac.uk/research/subject-groups/bs/">Behavioural Science Group</a> at Warwick Business School. I am also a research fellow at Oxford University's <a href="https://wellbeing.hmc.ox.ac.uk/">Wellbeing Research Centre</a>, a research affiliate at the <a href="https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/">Institute for New Economic Thinking</a>, and chair of the board of the <a href="https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/">Happier Lives Institute</a>.</p>
            
            <p>My research focuses on the measurement and determinants of wellbeing.</p>
            
            <p>Regarding measurement, I work on improving the comparability of survey data on people's feelings and analyse whether such data can measure welfare cardinally. Concerning determinants, I am particularly interested in how social comparisons and inequalities, particularly with respect to household incomes, shape people's wellbeing.</p>
            
            <p>Beyond these foci, I am interested in the wider normative implications of using subjective data, questions of welfare measurement more generally, the determinants and consequences of social mobility, as well as developments in causal inference and machine learning.</p>
            
            <p>I hold a DPhil in Social Policy from <a href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/">Nuffield College</a> and the <a href="https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Social Policy & Intervention</a>. Brian Nolan (INET, Oxford) and Maarten Vendrik (SBE, Maastricht) supervised my doctorate. Before joining Warwick, I was a postdoc at Oxford University and an Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/socialsciences/organization/departments/methodology-statistics">Department of Methodology and Statistics</a> at Tilburg University.</p>
